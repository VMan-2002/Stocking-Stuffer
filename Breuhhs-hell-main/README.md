# Welcome to Stocking Stuffer!
## A small Balatro modjam mod about opening presents

Here's a short refresher of how you will participate in this mod:

1. Make a fork of this repo. You will not be able to push edits otherwise

2. You are to make 1 Wrapped Present and up to 5 Presents
  - The player can hold onto an infinite number of Presents
  - Presents have the unique property of triggering twice, once before and once after Joker calculations
  - Presents can also optionally be consumables if you so choose
  - It is recommended you choose between scoring or consumable, not using both unless you know exactly what you are doing
  - Presents can also have negative effects if you so choose, but this is not required
  - A template file is provided for you to derive from
  - You are not allowed to use loc_txt attributes. Please create your own localization under `localization/en-us/your_name.lua`. There is a template there for you to use as well
  - Presents are not necessarily Jokers! Use whatever you may see fit to represent your objects!

3. You are not allowed to change `main.lua` or `present_utils.toml`. If you require something to be changed, please contact an event organizer.
  - Pull requests with unauthorized changes to these files will be rejected

4. Once you are finished making your additions, create a Pull Request to the original repo!
  - Please refer to the rules in the Discord regarding PR conventions
  - You are not allowed to view Pull Requests from other participants. No peeking at your Christmas presents!
  - Please do not wait to create your Pull Request until the very end unless you absolutely have to. This makes it far easier for us to review submissions and ensure they are valid!

5. You have until December 15th to complete these tasks

### Have a happy holiday!
